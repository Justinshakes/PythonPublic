# pip install Pillow
# You can open an image (e.g., shirt.png) with code like:
# shirt = Image.open("shirt.png")

# You can get the width and height, respectively, of that image as a tuple with code like:
# size = shirt.size

# And you can overlay that image on top of another (e.g., photo) with code like
# photo.paste(shirt, shirt)
